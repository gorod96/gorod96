- 👋 Hi, I’m Gabriel! I'm currently serving in the US Army as a Human Resources Sergeant, but I've recently discovered my interest in programming! Now I'm looking to learn as much about programming as I can so I can get out of the Army and become a Software Developer.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning everything I can do with programming, and my first big project in mind is to learn how to develop an indie game. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#, but I've also dabbled with HTML, CSS, and Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that can improve my programming skills!
- 📫 You can reach me by phone at (785) 375-8791 (though keep time zones in mind because I'm currently stationed in Germany), or email me at gabriel.raymo.rodriguez@gmail.com
