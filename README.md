- 👀 I’m interested in learning everything I can!
- 🌱 I’m currently focusing on learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but I've also dabbled around with Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that can improve my developing skills!
- 📫 You can reach me by phone at (785) 375-8791 (though keep time zones in mind because I'm currently stationed in Germany), or email me at gabriel.raymo.rodriguez@gmail.com
